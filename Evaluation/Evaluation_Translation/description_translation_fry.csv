The first point functioned as a house and fruit seller's shop, owned solely by Giulia DOLFIN DA RIVA, a noble lady, who rented it to Salvator Marchesi at a rate of 59,520 denari. The second point also related to the shop and was owned by Andrea BASSANELLO, a reverend sir, with a lower rent of 14,880 denari, also rented to Salvator Marchesi.

By 1808, the geographic context shifted as the parcel was now located in the Dorsoduro district, specifically at the Zattere foundation, which possibly indicated an administrative change. It was identified to consist of two parts, including a courtyard and a building. Ownership transitioned to OSPEDALE CIVILE, known as S. Salvatore degli Incurabili, and to Eredi della fù Catterina DANTE, the latter holding a title of 'Rent'. The functions of the parcel evolved to encompass both a shop and a house.

Overall, the period saw a shift in ownership from individual nobles to institutional holders, a change in location from Riva grande to Dorsoduro, and an expansion of the parcel's functional roles and structural features. Such transformations underlined the evolving nature of property use and ownership within Venice.",在1808年，这个地块包括两个部分。第一部分：该地块位于多尔索杜罗区的扎特雷基础上，面积为281.178平方米。地块包括庭院和建筑。该地块的拥有者是被称为“不可治愈者的圣萨尔瓦托雷”的民事医院。第二部分：该地块位于多尔索杜罗区的扎特雷基础上，面积为281.178平方米。它用作商店和住宅，地块类型包括庭院和建筑。该地块的拥有者是已故卡特里娜·丹特的继承人，标题为“租赁”。,"在1740年，这个 parcels 包含2个点。点1的功能是房屋和水果商店，位于 Riva grande，在 sestiere DD。此 parcels 的所有者由一个部分组成。唯一的所有者是 Giulia DOLFIN DA RIVA，拥有贵族女性的称号。这个点已经租给了 Salvator Marchesi，租金为 59,520 denari。点2的功能是上述商店的发送，也位于 Riva grande，在 sestiere DD。此 parcels 的所有者由1个部分组成。所有者的全名是 Andrea BASSANELLO，拥有尊敬的先生的称号。这个点也租给了 Salvator Marchesi，租金为 14,880 denari。","这个地块在1740年至1808年间经历了重大变化。1740年，它由位于DD区Riva grande的两个不同的点组成。第一个点作为一栋房屋和水果商店，仅由贵族女士Giulia DOLFIN DA RIVA拥有，她将其以59,520丹利的租金租给萨尔瓦托·马尔凯西（Salvator Marchesi）。第二个点也与商店相关，由尊敬的安德烈亚·巴萨内洛（Andrea BASSANELLO）拥有，租金低至14,880丹利，同样租给萨尔瓦托·马尔凯西。

到1808年，该地块的地理位置发生了变化，现位于多尔索杜罗区，具体位于扎特尔（Zattere）基础，这可能表明了行政上的变更。它被识别为由两个部分组成，包括一个庭院和一栋建筑。所有权转移给了OSPEDALE CIVILE，亦称为S. Salvatore degli Incurabili，以及Eredi della fù Catterina DANTE，后者持有“租赁”的头衔。该地块的功能演变为既包括商店又包括房屋。

总体来看，这一时期的所有权从个别贵族转向机构持有者，位置从Riva grande转移到多尔索杜罗，以及该地块的功能角色和结构特征的扩展。这些变迁突显了威尼斯物业使用和所有权的不断演变。",2,2,3

Ownership in this period resided with Zuanne DONA, a nobleman, who held ownership of two points, and VICENTI GRANDE, a grand chancellor, who owned another. Each of these points was rented to different tenants, with rental amounts varying.

By 1808, the parcel had transitioned to the district of Castello, shifting away from its previous location in sestiere CS. The functions of the parcel also evolved, now encompassing a house and short function, accompanied by a courtyard and building. The ownership structure changed notably, as two new owners, DONA' Leonardo and DONA' Bartolameo, emerged. The ownership type shifted to Rent, indicating a possible move towards a more commercial approach to the property.

到了1808年，该区域已转移至Castello区，远离之前位于CS区的位置。该区域的功能也发生了变化，现在包括一栋住宅和短期功能，附带一个院子和建筑物。所有权结构明显变化，出现了两个新所有者，DONA' Leonardo和DONA' Bartolameo。所有权类型转变为租赁，表明该财产可能朝着更商业化的方向发展。

这一比较表明，该区域在六十八年的时间里在地点、功能和所有权方面经历了重大转变，可能反映了当时威尼斯城市景观的更广泛变化。",4,3,4

The ownership changed entirely, transitioning from the church of San Zaccaria to the Demanio, managed by the Ministry of Finance. The location noted a change as well, moving to a specific listing of Spechiera Street and Furnace Street while still being recognized within the district of San Marco.

The function of the parcel evolved as well; it served both as a shop and house, incorporating buildings and courtyards, reflecting possibly a change in land usage over time.

This transition in ownership from a general church factory to the specific parish indicates a more direct management and possibly a different administrative focus on the parcel. Additionally, while the earlier description indicated a predominance of rental agreements with varied individuals, the later description focused on a singular ownership type, which may imply a move towards a more consolidated or institutional management of the property.

从一般的教堂工厂到特定的教区的所有权转变，表明对该地块的管理变得更加直接，且可能在行政管理上有所不同。此外，早期的描述指出了与不同个人的租赁协议占主导地位，而后来的描述则专注于单一的所有权类型，这可能暗示向更为集中的或机构化的物业管理转变。总体来看，这些发展表明在近七十年间，地块的行政结构和功能使用可能都发生了变化。",4,3,4

到1808年，该区域转变为一个单一实体，位于SS. Apostles区的公爵街，亦称为Bembo。功能上转变为一栋带院子的房屋和建筑，表明结构的价值和复杂性可能有所增加。所有权集中在GASPARI Giovanni（也称为约翰·玛利亚及其兄弟）名下，暗示从贵族所有权向更商业化的实体转变，结合了租金和所有权头衔。值得注意的是，1808年的描述提到，上一个所有者GASPARI Giovanni Maria e Fratelli已去世，这可能暗示家族血统或财产管理的变化。

Additionally, the sisters Giovanna, Anna, and Chiara Dalla Balla became co-owners of their segment, all holding it under rental agreements, implying a shift towards shared ownership. Another part was owned by Benzon Camillo, who also had a rental ownership type.

This transformation signifies not only an increase in the number of ownerships but also a diversification in the use of the land, reflecting possible socio-economic developments in Venice during this period. The district consistently remained San Polo, suggesting stability in administrative boundaries despite significant changes occurring within the ownership and function of the parcel itself.",在1808年，这个地块包括4个部分。第1部分：该地块位于圣保罗区，磨坊基金会，面积为67.822平方米。它作为仓库使用，类型为建筑。该地块的所有者是ZEN FABRIS Laura，拥有租赁权。第2部分：该地块位于圣保罗区，磨坊基金会，面积为67.822平方米。该地块作为建筑使用。该地块的所有者是Possessore ignoto。第3部分：该地块位于圣保罗区，磨坊基金会，面积为67.822平方米。它作为住宅使用，并被归类为建筑。该地块的所有者是Giovanna Dalla Balla、Anna Dalla Balla和Chiara Dalla Balla，她们是姐妹。此外，这些姐妹根据租赁协议拥有该地块。所有者在威尼斯还有其他四处房产。第4部分：该地块位于圣保罗区，磨坊基金会，面积为67.822平方米。它作为住宅使用，并被分类为建筑。该地块的所有者是Benzon Camillo，拥有租赁所有权。,在1740年，这个地点的功能是一所房子，位于SP街区的Ca Molin庭院。这个地块的所有者由一部分组成。所有者的全名是Zuanne BARICH。这个地点已租给Antonio Mustò，租金为35712丹尼。,"在1740年至1808年期间，威尼斯的一块土地经历了重大变化。在1740年，它被识别为位于圣保罗区Corte di Ca Molin的一处住宅单元。当时的 propietario 是 Zuanne Barich，他将其租给了 Antonio Mustò，总租金为35,712丹纳里。

到了1808年，该地块被划分为四个独立的部分，全部位于圣保罗区的molino基础上。在功能上，该地块发生了变化，其中一部分用作仓库，其他部分仍继续作为建筑物使用。所有权结构发生了显著变化；不再是单一的 владельец，而是多个拥有者分别占有各个部分。Zen Fabris Laura 获得了其中一部分的所有权，而另一部分则由一位身份不明的所有者占有。此外，姐妹 Giovanna、Anna 和 Chiara Dalla Balla 成为她们所占部分的共同拥有者，所有权均由租赁协议所控制，暗示着向共享所有权的转变。另一部分则由 Benzon Camillo 所有，他也采用租赁所有权的形式。

这一转变不仅意味着拥有者数量的增加，还意味着土地使用的多样化，反映出这一时期威尼斯可能发生的社会经济发展。该地区始终保持为圣保罗区，表明尽管土地所有权及其功能发生了重大变化，但行政边界的稳定性得以保持。",4,4,2

In both descriptions, it remained located in the district of Frezzaria at San Marco, indicating continuity in its geographic positioning. However, the functions of the parcel evolved; while it previously housed a tailor's shop and an oil workshop with residential elements, by 1808 it served as a combined shop and house, focusing more on commercial use.

Ownership transitioned significantly during this period. In 1740, the parcel was divided among two separate owners: Alvise Gritti, a tailor, and Agnese Gradenigo, a resident, each with distinct properties. By 1808, the parcel became the sole possession of Pietro Spangher, associated with the title of Rent, suggesting a change towards a single ownership model. This new ownership structure might imply a consolidation of property or a shift in investment strategy toward more rental-oriented management.

Furthermore, the transition also marked a generational shift, as Pietro Spangher was noted to be the son of Nicolò Spangher, who had passed away. The earlier owners were not connected by such familial ties, hinting at a potential evolution in socio-economic dynamics within the parcel’s ownership.

Overall, the changes reflected a movement from multiple distinct owners and varied functions to a singular ownership with a streamlined purpose, which may suggest adaptations to the economic environment or shifts in urban development trends within Venice during this time frame.",在1808年，该地块位于圣马可区，弗雷泽里亚，面积为120.691平方米。它作为商店和住宅使用，地块类型包括一栋建筑。该地块的拥有者是SPANGHER Pietro（尼古拉斯的儿子），拥有租赁的产权。拥有者的父亲是SPANGHER Nicolò，但他已去世。该拥有者在威尼斯还拥有另一个物业。,在1740年，这个地块包含2个部分。部分1是一个裁缝店，位于SM的Frezzaria。该地块的所有者为1个部分。所有者的全名为阿尔维塞·格里蒂，拥有裁缝的头衔。这个部分租给了阿尔维塞·波泽托，租金为38688德纳里。部分2是一个油坊和两个阳光房的住宅，位于SM的Frezzaria。该地块的所有者为1个部分。所有者的全名为阿涅塞·格拉德尼戈，拥有居民的头衔。这个部分租给了乔瓦尼·巴蒂斯塔·瓦塞林，租金为119040德纳里。,"所分析的威尼斯地块在1740年至1808年期间经历了显著的变化。在两个描述中，它始终位于圣马可的弗雷扎里亚区，表明其地理位置的连续性。然而，地块的功能发生了演变；虽然之前它是一个裁缝铺和一个带住宅元素的油坊，但到1808年，它则变成了一个集商店和住宅于一体的场所，更侧重于商业用途。

在此期间，所有权发生了显著的转变。在1740年，该地块分为两个独立的所有者：裁缝阿尔维塞·格里蒂和居民阿涅塞·格拉登尼戈，各自拥有不同的财产。到1808年，该地块成为皮特罗·斯潘格尔的唯一财产，与租赁的头衔相关联，暗示着向单一所有权模式的转变。这种新的所有权结构可能意味着财产的整合或投资策略向更具租赁导向的管理方向转变。

此外，这一转变还标志着代际更替，因为皮特罗·斯潘格尔被认为是已故的尼科洛·斯潘格尔的儿子。早期的所有者之间并没有这种家庭联系，暗示着地块所有权中的社会经济动态可能出现了演变。

总体而言，变化反映了从多个不同所有者和多样化功能向单一所有权和简化目的的转变，这可能暗示着经济环境的适应或威尼斯在这一时期城市发展趋势的变化。",2,3,4

By 1808, the parcel's location shifted to the district of Dorsoduro, specifically near Capello Square. The function of the parcel remained consistent as a house, but it was categorized under a broader classification as a building. Ownership transitioned from the nobleman to the CAPITOLO dei Sacerdoti della CHIESA PARROCCHIALE di S.

到1808年，该地块的位置转移至多尔索杜罗区，具体位于卡佩洛广场附近。该地块的功能仍然保持为房屋，但其被归类为更广泛的建筑类别。所有权从贵族转移到了S. Barnaba教区祭司委员会，这表明所有权向社区或机构模式转变，此新安排被描述为租赁而非完全所有权。

The ownership of the parcel included Vettor Marcello and the Marcello family, who managed the rental of the properties to individuals such as Gabriel Malipiero and Francesco Rossi.

By 1808, the parcel remained in the same general area but was explicitly identified as being on Querina Street, indicating a potential shift in the way the location was described. The property transitioned into a single unit categorized as a building, suggesting perhaps an evolution in its physical structure or functionality. The ownership changed from the Marcello family to Giovanni Bragadin, who operated under a rental ownership type and held multiple properties in Venice, suggesting a consolidation of ownership in fewer but possibly more expansive assets.

The change from the Marcello family to Bragadin marked a significant shift in ownership and possibly in the management style of the parcel.

到1808年，该区域仍位于同一大致区域，但明确被识别为奎里纳街，这表明描述位置的方式可能发生了变化。该物业转变为一个单一单元，归类为建筑，这可能暗示其物理结构或功能的演变。所有权从马塞洛家族转移到乔瓦尼·布拉加丁，后者以租赁所有权的形式经营，并在威尼斯拥有多个物业，这表明所有权向更少但可能更大资产的集中化。

从马塞洛家族到布拉加丁的转变标志着所有权的重大变化，也可能涉及该区域管理风格的变化。失去前任所有者的家庭联系暗示着所有权向更加个体化的转型。尽管该区域作为住宅的基本功能保持一致，但描述上的更新则表明威尼斯城市景观和物业所有权中的社会经济动态可能发生的演变。",2,3,4

到1808年，地块的位置转移到处女女神的Salizzada和一条名为圣彼得的大街，仍然位于Castello区。尽管确切位置和所有权名称发生了变化，该地块仍继续作为住宅使用。值得注意的是，所有权转移到了威尼斯市政当局（COMUNE DI VENEZIA），其所有权来源于处女修道院，表明从宗教所有权转向市政管理。所有权类型变为租赁，可能反映了这一时期对物业管理的世俗化处理。

总之，这些比较突显了从特定的宗教所有权转变为市政控制的过程，同时地点命名有所调整，而地块的住宅功能则随时间维持不变。所有权的变化可能暗示了这一时期威尼斯对物业管理更广泛的社会变革。",3,3,3

Initially, in 1740, the parcel was situated in Calle de Albanesi, located in the sestiere DD, and was comprised of ten distinct points, each functioning primarily as houses or little houses. The sole owner during this time was Zuanne Barbarigo, an individual of illustrious title, who retained ownership across all points. Each of these points was rented out to various tenants, generating differing amounts of rent, highlighting a reliance on rental income from multiple tenants.

By 1808, the parcel had undergone a significant transformation, both in physical characteristics and ownership. The location shifted to the district of San Polo, specifically at the small square of S. Rocco. The characteristics of the parcel appeared to evolve from multiple rental properties into a single house with a courtyard, possibly indicating a consolidation of ownership or a change in the property's function. The ownership also changed, with Teresa Barbarigo de Simoni identified as the owner, who held a rental title and possessed no other properties in Venice. This transition perhaps signified a shift from a fragmented ownership structure under Zuanne Barbarigo to a more unified ownership model.

到1808年，该地块在物理特征和所有权上都发生了重大变化。位置转移到圣保罗区，具体位于圣罗科小广场。地块的特征似乎从多个租赁物业演变为一个带庭院的单一住宅，可能表明所有权的整合或物业功能的变化。所有权也发生了变化，特雷莎·巴尔巴里戈·德·西莫尼（Teresa Barbarigo de Simoni）被确认为所有者，她拥有一个租赁标题，并在威尼斯没有其他物业。这一转变或许标志着从扎万·巴尔巴里戈的分散所有权结构转向更为统一的所有权模式。

The ownership of these properties was primarily held by Nicolo Bartieri, who retained two of the points, while the third was owned by a member of the ZINELLI family, known for their illustrious title. Each point was leased to various tenants, indicating a rental arrangement that involved specific amounts of denari for each rented unit.

The original small houses evolved into a singular building, indicating a possible consolidation or redevelopment of the parcel's function towards a more unified residence. The ownership changed to the heirs of Gio Batta Buffetti, reflecting a shift in ownership lineage and potentially indicating an inheritance or transfer of property management. The new ownership type was identified as rent, suggesting that the parcel's utilization for rental income may have continued, but now under different management and with a potentially different scope.

到1808年，同一区域转变为圣十字区，并特别提到位于一个叔叔的院子里。原来的小房子演变为一座单一建筑，表明该区域的功能可能朝着更统一的居住形式进行了整合或再开发。所有权变更为Gio Batta Buffetti的继承人，反映了所有权血统的变化，可能指向继承或物业管理的转移。新类型的所有权被识别为租赁，暗示该区域继续用于租金收入，但现在在不同的管理下，且可能具有不同的范围。

总体而言，分析表明，该区域的物理布局、所有权血统和运营功能发生了转变，从多个出租的小房子变为一座整合的租赁建筑，可能反映了近七十年来威尼斯城市动态和物业管理实践的变化。",4,4,4

Both points were rented out to Nicolò Tosatti at separate rates.

By 1808, the parcel expanded to include three parts, all located on Toscana Street within the district of San Polo. The ownership transitioned towards a more complex structure, incorporating multiple owners. The first part was owned by Giovanni Zampiereti, who had inherited it, while the second part was jointly owned by several individuals, including the Peretis brothers and others, indicating a shift to a shared ownership model. The third part was also rented out, owned by Tomasini Degna Antonio as a tenant. This change in ownership types—from individual to joint ownership—suggested potential changes in how property was managed and utilized in Venice during this period.

Additionally, the function of the parcel evolved, with the warehouse component remaining but also including houses, reflecting a diversification in usage. The presence of multiple properties owned by the owners in 1808 hinted at a more extensive involvement in the real estate market compared to the earlier period, perhaps indicating an increase in property investment and economic activity in the area.

到1808年，该区域在功能和所有权上都发生了变化。它被整合为一个位于圣马可区的单一地块，具体位于卡农街和宽街，现在包括一家商店和一栋房屋，并增加了一个庭院和一栋建筑。所有权转移至朱塞佩·内格里，表明内格里家族的存在持续，但个体所有者发生了变化。此外，该区域的所有权类型转变为租赁，这可能反映了经济条件或物业管理实践随时间变化的情况。

总体而言，该区域展示了从1740年多个拥有不同租赁协议的所有者，到1808年的单一所有权结构的转变，这可能允许对不同功能的更大控制和整合。",4,3,2
