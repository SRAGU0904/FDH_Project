In 1740, the parcel was composed of four distinct points, each functioning primarily as houses with two shops, all situated on Calle del Giazzo in the district referred to as CS. The ownership during this period was split among four individuals: Zuane Almoro Barbaro, Tomaso Sandi, Gabriel Bommartini, and Anzolo Palazzini, with all points having been rented to Simon Rizzato at varying rental amounts.

By 1808, the composition of the parcel shifted to three parts, all located in the district of Castello, specifically on Salizzada S. Lio. The function of the parcel evolved to include a mix of shops and a house, and it was identified as a building type. Notably, the ownership of these parts changed hands to three different individuals: Catterina Pelandina, Alessandro Barbaro, and Antonio Augusto Manetta, all holding the parcel under a rental agreement as well.

The transition from four owners in 1740 to three different owners in 1808 might suggest a consolidation of ownership over the years. Additionally, the shift in location from Calle del Giazzo to Salizzada S. Lio indicates a change in the administrative or geographical context of the parcel. The evolution in the type of functions, from predominantly residential and commercial in 1740 to a clearer commercial focus in 1808, could reflect broader economic or social changes occurring in Venice during that timeframe.",1,1,1

In 1740, the parcel was divided into six distinct points, all located along Calle del Priuli in the sestiere Cannaregio (CN). The area served various functions, including houses, upper floors, and a pepian house, and was jointly owned by noblemen Lorenzo Tiepolo and Ferigo Tiepolo. This ownership was characterized by a rental system, with multiple tenants occupying the different points, each paying varying amounts of rent.

By 1808, the parcel had been consolidated into two main parts, still situated on Priuli Street within the Cannaregio district. The function of the parcel remained as a house, but it was defined as including both a building and a courtyard. The ownership shifted to new individuals, specifically Maria Venier, the widow of Contarini, and Pietro Pesaro, son of the late Leonardo Pesaro. Both owners utilized a rental ownership type, suggesting a transition from noble co-ownership to individual rentals.

The change in ownership type, from noble communal ownership in the 18th century to individual ownership in the 19th century, possibly reflects broader socio-economic transformations within Venice. The new owners possessed a significantly larger number of properties, with Maria Venier owning a total of 19 and Pietro Pesaro controlling 58, suggesting an increase in wealth concentration or diversification among property owners in Venice during this period.",1,0,1

In 1740, the parcel functioned as a house situated in Sotto il portico dei Santi, owned by Francesco DOMESTICI, who had rented it to Nadalin Fioretto for 35,712 denari. Conversely, by 1808, the parcel had shifted its location to the district of Dorsoduro, specifically saints' alley, and retained its function as a house while being categorized as a building.

Ownership changed from Francesco DOMESTICI in 1740 to Antonio ZENNARO in 1808, indicating a possible transfer of property rights or a shift in prominent local families. ZENNARO was identified as being from Pelestrina and had inherited this parcel after the death of his father, ZENNARO di Pelestrina. This new ownership structure implied that the lease arrangement remained in place, highlighting a continuity of rental status despite the change in ownership. 

Furthermore, ZENNARO had no other properties in Venice, contrasting with the prior owner, who had direct control over the parcel itself. This may suggest a consolidation of property within fewer familial lines by 1808, or possibly a decline in local land ownership diversity over this period. Overall, these transitions in location, ownership, and status reflected broader social and economic dynamics within Venice during the 18th century.",1,1,1

Ownership during this period included noble figures, such as Andrea Guerra and various members of the Guerra family, along with notable individuals like Alba Giustina Corner and Benedetto Balbi. The functions of the points included houses, shops, and a window shop, with rents varying significantly among the properties.

By 1808, the description condensed the parcel into three parts, still located within the district of Castello but specifically at the intersection of Salizada di San Francesco and Calle Erizzo. The ownership shifted to figures with rental titles, notably BALBI MOSCA e Fratelli, Polese Giuseppe, and COLETTI Giuseppe Maria, indicating a transition away from noble ownership to more commercial rental arrangements. The functions of the parcels evolved as well, with designations now focusing on shops and houses, uniformly classified as buildings.

By 1808, the parcel transitioned to a different location within the Cannaregio district, specifically in the area referred to as s.

The ownership resided solely with the Maffetti family, notable for their noble status, possessing the entire parcel as a single entity.

In contrast, by 1808, the ownership had transitioned to Elisabetta Maffetti, identified as a widow of Agostino ZEN, indicating a potential shift in family management owing to the death of her husband. This period marked a change in ownership type to rent, while the function of the parcel evolved to include a house as well as a courtyard and a building, suggesting an expansion of usage beyond the simple little houses from 1740. Additionally, Elisabetta Maffetti managed a broader portfolio with 12 other properties within Venice, providing insight into her significant standing as a property owner.

Overall, the changes reflect a transition in ownership from the Maffetti family to Elisabetta, alongside an evolution in the type and function of the parcel, potentially indicative of changing social and economic circumstances in the area.

At this point, the parcel was classified as a building, suggesting a possible evolution in its structural status or use. The ownership changed to the Comune di Venezia, which appeared to have acquired the parcel from the Scuola di S. Marco, indicating a transfer of ownership from a religious or educational organization to a municipal entity.

Importantly, ownership transitioned to multiple entities: the Comune di Venezia held the first part, while the second part was owned by Zancolo' Fratelli—potentially linked to the earlier owner—and the third part was owned by Angelica Sartori, the widow of Moretti. This shift in ownership types—both rental and municipal—suggested a transformation in property management and use within the parcel's vicinity.

The owners in 1808 were Giovanni Orseti Gerardi, the Fratelli Silvestrini, and Niccolò Contarini, each categorized under rent-type ownership. This change illustrates a transition from noble ownership to more diverse property management, possibly indicating a shift in social or economic dynamics of the area. Furthermore, the presence of a deceased former owner for Niccolò Contarini suggests a lineage of ownership and potential wealth distribution in the family, as he possessed multiple properties within the city.

The owner’s full name was Antonio FONTANA. This point had been rented to Zuanne Pradi for a rent of 56172 denari.","The geographic parcel in question experienced notable changes from 1740 to 1808. 

In 1740, the parcel encompassed several distinct points, all situated in Calle del Dose near the Campo in the sestiere of Castello (referred to as CS). Ownership was fragmented, with individual owners, including Giulio Tascha, Vettor Marcello, the church of Santa Maria Formosa (represented by procurators), the Zibletti family, and Antonio Fontana. Each point functioned as a portion of a house and was under various rental agreements, primarily with a tenant named Zuanne Pradi or Liberato Molin. 

By 1808, however, the parcel was consolidated into two primary parts, both located within the district of Castello, extending along Calle del Dose towards Marcello Bridge. The ownership shifted to two individuals, CALICHIOPOLI Spiridon and SILVESTRINI Pietro, both holding the title of Rent. The function of the parcel remained as a house, but it was now classified as a building, indicating a possible change in structure or use.

These changes indicate a transition from multiple ownerships to a more centralized ownership under fewer proprietors, alongside a geographical relocation from the sestiere of CS to a more precisely defined area within Castello. The evolution of the parcel from multiple rental agreements in 1740 to a couple of specific rent-based ownerships in 1808 suggests a possible trend toward consolidation and reclassification of property types in this area.",1,1,0

The owner of this parcel consisted of 1 part. The first owner was of the family group TREVISAN, holding the title of most illustrious abbot. This point had been rented to Illustrissimo Conte Bonafede. The rent included 104160 denari.","The geographic parcel in question underwent several notable changes from 1740 to 1808. Initially located in Fondamenta dei Sartori within the sestiere of Cannaregio, it continued to reside in Cannaregio, but shifted to a more specific area known as the district of SS. Apostles, Sagredo branch.

The function of the parcel remained predominantly that of a residence; however, by 1808, it expanded to include warehouse functionality, along with a courtyard and a building, indicating a diversification in its use over the years.

Ownership also transformed significantly during this period. In 1740, the parcel was owned by the TREVISAN family, specifically by most illustrious abbot, while rented to Illustrissimo Conte Bonafede. By 1808, Giuseppe Berlendis, also known as John, became the owner under rental terms, suggesting a change from the original ownership structure. Berlendis was related to a previous owner, Zuanne Berlendis, who had deceased, indicating a familial continuity in ownership but a shift in individual proprietorship.

Overall, the parcel's characteristics evolved from a single house associated with a noble title to a more complex property featuring multiple functions, reflecting possible changes in the socioeconomic environment and property usage patterns in Venice during this timeframe.",1,1,1

The rent included 13392 denari.","The geographic parcel of Venice underwent notable changes between 1740 and 1808. In 1740, the parcel contained three distinct points situated in Calle de Gobbi at the district of Santa Croce, owned solely by Zuanne Loredan, a noble man. Each point served varying functions, primarily as houses or an empty house, with rentals paid to Loredan totaling significant amounts in denari. 

By 1808, the parcel evolved into two parts, maintaining its location along Gobi Street in the Santa Croce district. However, the ownership transitioned from the noble Loredan to the Ufficio del Censo di questa Comune and also included a specific owner, Giacomo Berti (also known as Joseph) who retained the title of owner but under a rental arrangement. 

This indicates a shift from individual noble ownership to more institutional control and individual ownership defined by different tenant arrangements. The functionality of the parcel remained centered on housing, yet the administrative and ownership structure profoundly shifted, potentially reflecting broader socioeconomic trends within Venice during that period. The presence of Berti with multiple properties suggests a possible diversification of property ownership among individuals in the area.",1,1,1

Initially situated in Ruga d'Orefici verso San Giacomo in the sestiere of San Polo, the parcel continued to serve a commercial function as a goldsmith's shop. 

In 1740, the sole owner was Silvestro Valier Bembi, who had rented it out to Giulio Botti. However, by 1808, the ownership shifted to Cecilia Dolfin Lippomano, the daughter of the late Daniele Dolfin Lippomano and the heir of Andrea Dolfin Valier. This change in ownership possibly indicated a transition within the family line, as the presence of the heirs suggests a continuity of property within the Dolfin family.

Furthermore, the parcel was explicitly identified as a building, which may indicate a development in its physical structure or usage compared to its original description where it was simply noted as a shop. The new owner, Cecilia, also held ten additional properties in Venice, suggesting an expansion of her real estate portfolio and possibly reflecting the changing dynamics of property ownership in the region during this period.

The transition from a single owner managing a rental agreement in 1740 to a new owner with multiple properties demonstrates a potential shift in property management practices and economic circumstances within Venice. Overall, these changes painted a picture of evolving ownership and the potential diversification of property use in this specific geographic parcel over the span of nearly seven decades.",1,0,1

In 1740, the parcel was situated in Calle Terrazzera at sestiere CS, while by 1808, it had shifted to the district of Castello, specifically along Pietà Street, Terrazzera Street, and Bragola Field.

The function of the parcel also evolved over this period. In 1740, the parcel included various points serving as small houses and warehouses, with some properties being rented out at different rates. By 1808, all parts of the parcel were classified as buildings with specific functions as houses or warehouses, indicating a possible shift towards more permanent and established structures. 

Ownership dynamics experienced significant changes as well. In 1740, the ownership was attributed to notable figures such as Francesco Gabbiati, Gasparo Soranzo, and Antonio Zavanti, with some properties being part of influential families like the Morosini. Conversely, in 1808, the ownership transitioned to individuals like Angela Maria Gabiati, Giacomo Soranzo, Nicolò Bone, and Giovanni Battista Coledani, all classified under rent.
